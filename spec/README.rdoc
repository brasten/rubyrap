There are several directories here that contain fake projects and repositories
for testing. This README explains what they are.


=== fixtures

Sample repositories in various states of validity, used for testing repository code.


=== projects

Sample projects used for testing project, dependency, and packaging code.


=== artifacts (generated?)

Artifacts generating in the course of running specs. Kind of a temp directory.
